# On The WordPress Admin Dashboard

In general, the best custom WordPress Admin products "feel" like they belong in the greater application or a greater extending suite of tools. This means relying on WordPress Admin interface patterns and existing CSS whenever possible.

There are many ways to do buttons -- use WordPress' variants whenever possible, perhaps with a custom skin.

There are many ways to do loaders, use [a simple, CSS version](https://codepen.io/kuus/pen/jwnEm) of the WordPress one wherever possible (the GIFs are block other HTTP requests and dealing with densities and sizing is no fun).

There are many ways to do horizontal tabs -- try to rely on WordPress' 3-4 options (see [Patterns](https://github.com/0aveRyan/patterns)).

There are many ways to do Modals -- try to use the WordPress Backbone modal or Thickbox Iframes / Inline Frames.
